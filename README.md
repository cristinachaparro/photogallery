## Overview

<img src="readmeimg/mobileview.png">

This is an IG styled photo gallery that I've been working on for Devchallenges.io. 

I chose this project for two main reasons, the first one is that I'm a photography lover myself, so it can be useful for me in the future; and the second one is that I feel that personal photography/product websites are quite trendy lately so it was worth learning how to create a site like this.

My main challenge here was to discover how to place each picture in this Pinterest-like layout, and that it kept that way even when using smaller screens. I tried placing each picture separately and the result wasn't good, but then I learned about CSS grid - which was completely new to me - and it was key to develop the website and make it look as I wanted.

As a side note, I also learned to look closely since I hadn't realised about certain margins between elements, or even the soft shadows under each picture. I was so focused on getting everything right in the place they had to be that I almost forgot about smaller details that make the site look good as well.

### Built With

HTML and CSS.
